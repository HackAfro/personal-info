Hello Sir/Ma,  

I'm Richard Umoffia, a software engineer with thorough hands-on experience in web development, 
web performance optimization and the ability to troubleshoot and solve problems in a timely and accurate manner. 

Iâ€™ve been described as a supportive and enthusiastic team player dedicated to streaming processes and efficiency.  
My professional experience includes using programming languages and frameworks such as Angular, React,
Python and JavaScript to create various features for web platforms.

I also have experience in developing server-side applications using Node.js and Django and managing continuous
integration pipelines using CircleCI and GitHub actions. Combine this with my ability to thrive in a 
collaborative environment, and I think that makes me a perfect fit for your company.  

As a true believer in continued education, I am continuously researching and seeking new software and methods to 
assist with product development. I hope to bring my knowledge, and future knowledge, to your organization. 
Attached is a copy of my resume that further explains my background and technical skills.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.  

Sincerely, Richard Umoffia
